# Spam_detection
This is a project for spam detection. The goal of this project is to classify spams. We built a system based on three classifiers Long short-term memory(LSTM), multinomial naive bayes(MNB), and ExtratreesClassifier. The classification is made by the majority of votes obtained from classifiers. We used data from Kaggle.
